      <description>So this is not my first blog post.
My original blog was better suited for a documentation/wiki website which is now hosted here.
Originally I hosted my blog on Dreamhost which worked pretty well. Dreamhost made it really easy to setup WordPress but I got tired of paying to have the blog hosted there. So I moved the site to WordPress.com but found that while I could host the site for free I would have to pay a fee per month to modify the CSS.</description>
